# Gesture-Controlled-Virtual-Switch

Using the MediaPipeHands library from Google's MediaPipe framework to try and create a gesture-controlled switch that uses simple hand gestures to control something hardware (virtual for now) in Arduino

- using OpenCV + MediaPipe for real time hand-tracking and gesture-recognition
- possible applications for IoT, assistive technology, etc
